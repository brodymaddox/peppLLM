        "Expected Response": "Many students who choose to study abroad for one semester later ask to extend their contract to remain abroad for a longer period of time. We accommodate these students when possible, but can only accommodate extensions on a space available basis and if visas regulations allow for it. Therefore it's best for students to apply for the academic year from the beginning (if their academic plan can allow for it) in order to hold their space in that program and in order to secure a visa if necessary. Students who have only attended one semester tell us time and time again that they wished they had stayed the full academic year."

        "Question": "Should I have other study abroad locations in mind when I apply?",
        "Expected Response": "Yes! Due to space constraints, our programs cannot always accommodate all applicants.

    {
        "Question": "Why are priority applications due about a month after the beginning of the fall semester?",
        "Expected Response": "Prior to going on a semester or Academic Year International Program, students are required to take the first level of a language class (151) for all fall and spring programs (except Washington, D.C. and London programs), as well as other prerequisite courses prior to attending their international program. Students will register for these spring classes in early to mid-November. Due to this registration timeline, International Programs has created an application process and timeline to review students, give them a decision, and leave enough time for them to review their contracts and commit to the program prior to the November registration dates. This allows students to register in the appropriate classes before going abroad, so that they can complete all necessary prerequisites."

        "Question": "Who teaches the courses in International Programs?",

    {
        "Question": "What does it mean if I was waitlisted for a program and what should I do?",
        "Expected Response": "Due to space constraints and other factors, we often cannot accept all applicants for a given program. Students placed on the waitlist may choose to remain on the waitlist for the chance to be admitted at a later date if space becomes available, or they may choose to reapply for an alternate program, as long as that program is accepting new applications. Click here for more information."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What happens after I am accepted?",
        "Expected Response": "Students who have been accepted are asked to sign an IP contract to officially commit to their program and term.

    },
    {
        "Question": "Can I arrange my own travel to the program?",
        "Expected Response": "No. When signing a contract, a student agrees to the flight policies, which require them to book through Pepperdine's travel partner, Corniche Travel. Booking with Corniche provides students with a variety of benefits, including:"
    },
    {
        "Question": "What opportunities are there for travel?",
        "Expected Response": "Traveling to selected destinations will definitely be a part of your educational experience.

Join us as we celebrate your time abroad and share all your adventures with the new freshmen class. We also partner with alumni for all our events and orientations. If you are interested in sharing about your time abroad, please reach out to the program ambassador."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What are the withdrawal fees if I decide to break my contract?",
        "Expected Response": "It depends on the term for which you signed your contract, and the date that you withdraw.

    },
    {
        "Question": "Do I travel on every weekend while abroad?",
        "Expected Response": "Studying abroad is an invitation to learn more about your host county, culture, and its people. So feel free to travel all the time or none of the time, have adventures in your host country and see what you find. Do you travel every weekend now? No! Do you know how tired you would be if you travelled every weekend? Very! Consider what you would miss out on in the place you decided to study in the first place! Maybe you'll find some good gelato, maybe some friends, and *disclaimer for this wild thought* maybe yourself (Shhhh this is the best kept secret about studying abroad but I'll share it just with you)"
