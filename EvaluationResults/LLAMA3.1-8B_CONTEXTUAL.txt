Question: Should I apply for one semester or a year?
Ideal response: Many students who choose to study abroad for one semester later ask to extend their contract to remain abroad for a longer period of time. We accommodate these students when possible, but can only accommodate extensions on a space available basis and if visas regulations allow for it. Therefore it's best for students to apply for the academic year from the beginning (if their academic plan can allow for it) in order to hold their space in that program and in order to secure a visa if necessary. Students who have only attended one semester tell us time and time again that they wished they had stayed the full academic year.
Model response: Should I apply for one semester or a year? What is the difference?
Applying for one semester gives you the opportunity to study abroad for one semester, while applying for a year allows you to study abroad for two semesters.

Question: Why are priority applications due about a month after the beginning of the fall semester?
Ideal response: Prior to going on a semester or Academic Year International Program, students are required to take the first level of a language class (151) for all fall and spring programs (except Washington, D.C. and London programs), as well as other prerequisite courses prior to attending their international program. Students will register for these spring classes in early to mid-November. Due to this registration timeline, International Programs has created an application process and timeline to review students, give them a decision, and leave enough time for them to review their contracts and commit to the program prior to the November registration dates. This allows students to register in the appropriate classes before going abroad, so that they can complete all necessary prerequisites.
Model response: Why are priority applications due about a month after the beginning of the fall semester? It is important that priority applications be completed in a timely manner so that the Admissions Office can process them and send out admissions decisions before the first day of classes.

Question: What does it mean if I was waitlisted for a program and what should I do?
Ideal response: Due to space constraints and other factors, we often cannot accept all applicants for a given program.

Model response: What does it mean if I was waitlisted for a program and what should I do? If you were waitlisted for a program, it means that you have been deemed a viable candidate for the program. However, the program is still looking for additional candidates. It is possible that you will be offered admission to the program at a later date. If you are waitlisted, you should contact the program to find out if there is anything you can do to improve your chances of being offered admission.
