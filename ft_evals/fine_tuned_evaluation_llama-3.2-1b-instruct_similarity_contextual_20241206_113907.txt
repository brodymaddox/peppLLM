Question: Should I apply for one semester or a year?
Ideal response: Many students who choose to study abroad for one semester later ask to extend their contract to remain abroad for a longer period of time. We accommodate these students when possible, but can only accommodate extensions on a space available basis and if visas regulations allow for it. Therefore it's best for students to apply for the academic year from the beginning (if their academic plan can allow for it) in order to hold their space in that program and in order to secure a visa if necessary. Students who have only attended one semester tell us time and time again that they wished they had stayed the full academic year.
Model response: Should I apply for one semester or a year? The decision of how long to take a class depends on several factors. Here are some points to consider:

### 1. **Academic Goals**
- **Short-term goals**: If you're looking to quickly complete a specific course or degree program, a semester might be a better option.
- **Long-term goals**: If you're aiming for a specific career or graduate degree, a year might be more beneficial.

### 2. **Financial Considerations**
- **Semester courses**: These are often less expensive than a year.
- **Year-long courses**: These can be more cost-effective, especially if you're taking classes at a public institution.

### 3. **Time Management**
- **Short-term courses**: These can be completed in

Therefore we ask students to be open to multiple locations and apply by the priority deadline for the greatest chance of admission.
Model response: Should I have other study abroad locations in mind when I apply?

Programs that require an interview or audition, such as Faculty-led, internship, and language-intensive programs will not be available as an alternate choice.
Model response: Can I apply for more than one program? (Yes, but with some limitations)
You can apply to more than one program, but there are some limitations to consider:
1. **Programs with similar requirements**: If you apply to multiple programs with similar requirements, you may be competing for the same spot. You can still apply to multiple programs, but you may need to create separate applications or waitlists.
2. **Programs with different funding or financial aid**: If you apply to multiple programs with different funding or financial aid, you may need to create separate applications or waitlists. Some programs may have different funding or financial aid structures, such as need-based aid or merit-based aid.

Question: Why are priority applications due about a month after the beginning of the fall semester?
Ideal response: Prior to going on a semester or Academic Year International Program, students are required to take the first level of a language class (151) for all fall and spring programs (except Washington, D.C. and London programs), as well as other prerequisite courses prior to attending their international program. Students will register for these spring classes in early to mid-November. Due to this registration timeline, International Programs has created an application process and timeline to review students, give them a decision, and leave enough time for them to review their contracts and commit to the program prior to the November registration dates. This allows students to register in the appropriate classes before going abroad, so that they can complete all necessary prerequisites.
Model response: Why are priority applications due about a month after the beginning of the fall semester? 

## Step 1: Understand the context of the question
The question is asking why priority applications for the fall semester are due about a month after the beginning of the semester.

## Step 2: Identify the purpose of priority applications
Priority applications are typically used to reserve a spot for students in a particular program or course, ensuring they have a place in the desired class.

## Step 3: Consider the timeline of the semester
The fall semester is typically divided into two parts: the beginning of the semester and the middle of the semester. The middle of the semester is usually around 8-10 weeks into the semester.

## Step 4: Analyze the timing of the application deadline

Question: What does it mean if I was waitlisted for a program and what should I do?
Ideal response: Due to space constraints and other factors, we often cannot accept all applicants for a given program. Students placed on the waitlist may choose to remain on the waitlist for the chance to be admitted at a later date if space becomes available, or they may choose to reapply for an alternate program, as long as that program is accepting new applications. Click here for more information.
Model response: What does it mean if I was waitlisted for a program and what should I do? 

A waitlist is a list of students who have been accepted to a program but have not yet received an offer to attend. They are not guaranteed admission, and they may be invited to attend if the program fills up. If you were waitlisted, it means that the program was not yet full, and you were placed on the waitlist.

Here are some steps you can take:

1. **Don't panic**: A waitlist is not a reflection of your worth or ability. It's a common process in the admissions process.
2. **Check your email and phone**: If you were waitlisted, you should receive an email from the program indicating that they are still considering your application. You can also check your phone for any notifications.
