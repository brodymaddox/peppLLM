Question: Should I apply for one semester or a year?
Ideal response: Many students who choose to study abroad for one semester later ask to extend their contract to remain abroad for a longer period of time. We accommodate these students when possible, but can only accommodate extensions on a space available basis and if visas regulations allow for it. Therefore it's best for students to apply for the academic year from the beginning (if their academic plan can allow for it) in order to hold their space in that program and in order to secure a visa if necessary. Students who have only attended one semester tell us time and time again that they wished they had stayed the full academic year.

Question: Should I have other study abroad locations in mind when I apply?
Ideal response: Yes! Due to space constraints, our programs cannot always accommodate all applicants. Historically, about 2 out of 3 students who apply are admitted to their first choice program. Therefore we ask students to be open to multiple locations and apply by the priority deadline for the greatest chance of admission.
Model response: Should I have other study abroad locations in mind when I apply? I'd like to consider other countries, but I'm not sure if they're within the same continent as the US or if they're even feasible for me.

Some examples of countries that I'm considering include:

* Australia
* New Zealand
* Canada
* Germany
* France
* Italy
* Spain

I'd like to know if these countries are feasible for me to study abroad in, and if so, what kind of programs or opportunities are available. I'd also like to know if there are any restrictions or requirements that I should be aware of.

Are there any specific requirements or qualifications that I need to meet in order to be eligible for a study abroad program?

Question: Can I apply for more than one program?
Ideal response: Students have the option to be considered for up to six programs and terms with one application.

Programs that require an interview or audition, such as Faculty-led, internship, and language-intensive programs will not be available as an alternate choice.

Question: When will I know whether or not I am accepted?
Ideal response: First, ensure that you have completed all required steps including submitting all parts of your online application, and interviewing or auditioning if required. Be sure to pay attention to all deadlines indicated on the application. Click here to learn more about the requirements for each program.

Applicants who apply by the priority deadline (September 23, 2024) will receive a decision on October 11, 2024. Applicants will be notified via email (make sure to allow emails from @via-trm.com to be able to receive a decision). Applicants who apply after the priority deadline will be notified on a rolling basis, usually on Fridays (this usually takes 2-4 weeks).
Model response: When will I know whether or not I am accepted? The answer to this question is not as simple as it seems.
The college or university you are applying to is not the only factor that determines whether or not you are accepted. Other factors such as the student's academic record, personal statement, and extracurricular activities also play a role.
It is not uncommon for students to be rejected by multiple colleges or universities before they are accepted by one. This can happen if the student's academic record is not strong enough, or if their personal statement or extracurricular activities do not meet the requirements of the college or university they are applying to.
In order to increase their chances of being accepted, students should work on their academic record, prepare their personal statement, and participate in extracurricular

Other positions are also available once in your program. Program directors will be reaching out to students the first month of the program
Model response: Are there jobs for students while abroad? Yes, many!

When students study abroad, they often face challenges in finding employment while they're on the ground. However, many countries offer programs specifically designed to help international students find work while abroad.

Here are some ways students can find jobs while abroad:

1.  **International Student Programs**: Many universities and colleges offer international student programs that provide job search assistance, career counseling, and professional development opportunities.
2.  **Job Boards and Websites**: Students can search for job openings on international job boards and websites, such as International Student Jobs, Internships, and Work Abroad.
3.  **Networking**: Students can connect with their peers, alumni, and industry professionals to learn about job opportunities and get advice on their career paths.

Question: Why are priority applications due about a month after the beginning of the fall semester?
Ideal response: Prior to going on a semester or Academic Year International Program, students are required to take the first level of a language class (151) for all fall and spring programs (except Washington, D.C. and London programs), as well as other prerequisite courses prior to attending their international program. Students will register for these spring classes in early to mid-November. Due to this registration timeline, International Programs has created an application process and timeline to review students, give them a decision, and leave enough time for them to review their contracts and commit to the program prior to the November registration dates. This allows students to register in the appropriate classes before going abroad, so that they can complete all necessary prerequisites.
Model response: Why are priority applications due about a month after the beginning of the fall semester? 

This question is related to the discussion of the "priority" in the context of the application process. In the context of the application process, the priority refers to the order in which applicants are considered for admission. This is often the case when the application process involves multiple rounds of review. 

For the purpose of this discussion, a "priority" application is defined as an application that is due within a specified timeframe, usually a month, after the start of the semester. 

In the context of the fall semester, the priority application would be due around September 1st. 

It is worth noting that the priority application is not the same as the "early decision" application, which is typically due a few days before the start of the semester

Question: What does it mean if I was waitlisted for a program and what should I do?
Ideal response: Due to space constraints and other factors, we often cannot accept all applicants for a given program. Students placed on the waitlist may choose to remain on the waitlist for the chance to be admitted at a later date if space becomes available, or they may choose to reapply for an alternate program, as long as that program is accepting new applications. Click here for more information.
Model response: What does it mean if I was waitlisted for a program and what should I do? 

A waitlist is a list of students who are waiting for a particular program. If you're on a waitlist, you might not be accepted into the program until it's full. Here are some things to do if you're on a waitlist:

1.  **Check the waitlist status**: Look for the "Waitlist" or "Current Waitlist" section on the program's website. This will tell you if you're still on the waitlist or if you've been accepted.
2.  **Contact the program**: Reach out to the program's admissions office or waitlist coordinator to ask about your waitlist status. They can let you know if you're still on the list or if you've been accepted.

Question: What opportunities are there for travel?
Ideal response: Traveling to selected destinations will definitely be a part of your educational experience. However, these are serious academic programs and your studies must come first. Also, don't overlook exploring and learning about the city and country in which your program is located by visiting only distant places. There is an educational field trip in both the fall and spring terms of each academic year program. Be sure to review our flight policies here.
Model response: What opportunities are there for travel? 
The university is located in a city, but it is not a major tourist destination. As a result, travel opportunities are limited. However, there are some options available:
 
* The university has a shuttle service that runs between the campus and nearby cities. The shuttle runs on a fixed schedule, so you can plan your trips in advance.
* The university is within a short drive of several nearby cities, including a major airport.
* The university is also within a short drive of several national parks and other outdoor recreation areas.
 
The university's budget for international travel is limited, and students are expected to cover their own expenses. However, there are some exceptions:
 
* The university offers a limited number of scholarships for students who are interested in

Ideal response: If the guest helps multiple students, the guest may click the "Select Another Student" link at the bottom of the current student's Guest Access summary to switch to another student.
Model response: How do I help mutiple students as a guest? 
As a guest, you are not a student, but you can still help out as a helper. Here are some ways to assist:

1.  **Assist with daily tasks**: Offer to help with tasks such as cleaning, laundry, or meal preparation. This will not only be a great way to assist the students but also give you a chance to learn new skills and build your confidence.
2.  **Provide emotional support**: If you notice any students who are struggling, offer a listening ear and a friendly smile. Your presence can make a big difference in their day.
3.  **Help with language barriers**: If you're fluent in a language other than the one the students are using, offer to help with translation or interpretation.

Question: What is the grade dispute process? 
Ideal response: 
This policy outlines the procedure that a student must follow in the event that he/she wishes to dispute the grade
received in a course at Seaver College.


This process must be initiated by the student before the midpoint of the next non-summer semester, which
immediately follows the course in question.


Most grade issues can and should be resolved privately between the student and instructor. This is the starting
point with all grade disputes. In case the matter is not satisfactorily resolved by these means, the following appeals
procedure shall apply:


1. The student shall submit a written appeal to the division dean with a copy to the instructor identifying the
course, semester, grade received, and the reason for the appeal.
2. The student shall assemble all relevant class materials (syllabi, returned assignments, tests, papers, etc.)
distributed or returned by the instructor to the student. These materials need to be compiled within two
weeks of the date of the written appeal. If the student cannot assemble all such documents, the grade dispute
is concluded with no grade change.
3. Concurrently, the instructor will assemble all relevant class materials that he or she retained for this student
(final exams, midterms, etc.) within two weeks of the date of the written appeal. A copy of these documents
along with the syllabus, grade book, and the instructor's written response to the student appeal is to be
forwarded by the instructor to the division dean. If the instructor cannot produce all relevant documents
pertinent to the student's work in the course, the grade dispute will be taken up by the instructor's division
dean in consultation with the associate dean.
4. The chair will appoint an ad hoc committee of two faculty members within the division who teach the course
(or a similar one) in question. This committee will then evaluate the student's course materials based on the
following criteria:


 Have all assignments and examinations been administered in accordance with the guidelines set forth in
the class syllabus?
 Has all student work been graded fairly, consistently, and accurately?
At the conclusion of the committee's evaluation of the course material, it will submit a written recommendation
and explanation to the division dean. The recommendation must be one of the following:


1. Uphold the grade given by the instructor, or
2. Require that the instructor re-grade one or more assignments, followed by a recalculation of the student's
grade, or
3. Require that the instructor formulate a repeat of one or more class assignments or assessments, followed by
a recalculation of the student's grade, or
4. Recommend a specified grade change


Based on the ad hoc committee's findings, it shall be the division dean's decision, in consultation with the
associate dean of Seaver College, as to whether the grade shall be changed. This decision will be final. No further
appeal is possible.

Question: How do parking permits work?
Ideal response: Enter the vehicle information and purchase a parking permit in the parking portal website.

Question: I'm a student with a disability. How do I apply for accomodations?
Ideal response: Step One
Complete an online inquiry to begin the process of applying for accommodations.
Step Two
After completing the online inquiry, students will receive the following in an email to guide them in providing appropriate documentation. Students should upload said documentation to their file through Wavenet (instructions will be in the email):
Documentation/Pepperdine Accessibility Form: The Pepperdine Accessibility Form is a tool that students may use to provide guidance to medical or psychological professionals regarding the information needed to complete the file. Please choose the form(s) most appropriate to your needs. There are two types of Pepperdine Accessibility Forms including:
Pepperdine Accessibility Form - Initial form
Housing and ESA Addendum - To be submitted (in addition to the Pepperdine Accessibility Form) for housing and esa requests
Guidelines for Documentation of a Disability: This is a comprehensive guide to the information needed to complete the file. For students seeking accommodations for ADD or for a learning disability, the OSA requests additional documentation to the disability verification form (this information is listed in the guidelines).
Accommodation letters should be included in the documentation submitted for those who have received prior accommodations in high school, other undergraduate or graduate institutions, or on the ACT/SAT/GMAT/LSAT etc.
Step Three
Once you have submitted the documentation, OSA will be notified through the Accommodate System.  OSA will send you a scheduling link to your Pepperdine email to arrange a conversation with an Accessibility Specialist.  Please be on the lookout for the scheduling link.
This conversation is designed to give the directors a narrative about a student's disability and the barriers it presents to their education. The student and specialist will together discern how Pepperdine can best support the student.
In most cases, students may expect a written communication from OSA within five to ten business days of meeting with the Accessibility Specialist.  This communication will include either an accommodation decision, a request for more information, or instructions on next steps.  Students choose with whom to share this letter. Accommodations will not be offered until a letter is presented to professors or appropriate staff.

Question: How can I request a refund?
Ideal response: Refunds from federal aid will be processed automatically at the start of each term. You do not need to do anything other than make sure you have a valid eRefund account set up about two weeks prior to the start of the term.

In order to expedite the process, we ask that you do not call the office regarding the status of your refund during the following times of the term: the week prior to the start of the term or the first two weeks of the term. 

Students may check their WaveNet account to see when the refund has been processed. It will show up in the "Refund" column under the Account Activity. Once on the student account, the funds will be released to the banks (for those with an eRefund) at the close of business the following day. It then takes generally 3-7 business days for the bank to deposit the funds into the bank account designated on the eRefund.

For refund requests on any other credit balance throughout the semester, students may contact the Office of Student Accounts by phone at (310) 506-8000 or using their Pepperdine email account, send an email to SeaverSA@pepperdine.edu. All requests for refunds must come from the student.
