Question: Should I apply for one semester or a year?
Ideal response: Many students who choose to study abroad for one semester later ask to extend their contract to remain abroad for a longer period of time. We accommodate these students when possible, but can only accommodate extensions on a space available basis and if visas regulations allow for it. Therefore it's best for students to apply for the academic year from the beginning (if their academic plan can allow for it) in order to hold their space in that program and in order to secure a visa if necessary. Students who have only attended one semester tell us time and time again that they wished they had stayed the full academic year.
Model response: Should I apply for one semester or a year? 
I have to decide between applying for a semester or a year, and Im not sure which one is better for me. 

Applying for a semester or a year, the following are the key differences:
 
A semester typically lasts 12 weeks, while a year typically lasts 24 weeks.
Applying for a semester will allow you to complete your course requirements within a shorter period of time, while applying for a year will give you more time to complete your course requirements.
Applying for a year will also give you more time to focus on your personal and academic goals.
A year is a more significant commitment than a semester, so its best to consider it carefully before making a decision.

Question: Should I have other study abroad locations in mind when I apply?
Ideal response: Yes! Due to space constraints, our programs cannot always accommodate all applicants. Historically, about 2 out of 3 students who apply are admitted to their first choice program. Therefore we ask students to be open to multiple locations and apply by the priority deadline for the greatest chance of admission.
Model response: Should I have other study abroad locations in mind when I apply? 
Yes, it is a good idea to research other countries that may be suitable for your interests and academic goals. Consider the following factors when making your decision:
1. Academic requirements: Does the program in the country you're considering meet the academic requirements for your chosen field of study?
2. Language requirements: Are the languages spoken in the country you're considering required for your program?
3. Cultural differences: Are there cultural differences that may impact your academic experience or personal growth?
4. Cost: What are the costs associated with living and studying in the country you're considering?
5. Visa requirements: Are you eligible for a visa to study in the country you're considering?

Programs that require an interview or audition, such as Faculty-led, internship, and language-intensive programs will not be available as an alternate choice.
Model response: Can I apply for more than one program?

Question: Why are priority applications due about a month after the beginning of the fall semester?
Ideal response: Prior to going on a semester or Academic Year International Program, students are required to take the first level of a language class (151) for all fall and spring programs (except Washington, D.C. and London programs), as well as other prerequisite courses prior to attending their international program. Students will register for these spring classes in early to mid-November. Due to this registration timeline, International Programs has created an application process and timeline to review students, give them a decision, and leave enough time for them to review their contracts and commit to the program prior to the November registration dates. This allows students to register in the appropriate classes before going abroad, so that they can complete all necessary prerequisites.
