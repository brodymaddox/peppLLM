Question: Should I apply for one semester or a year?
Ideal response: Many students who choose to study abroad for one semester later ask to extend their contract to remain abroad for a longer period of time. We accommodate these students when possible, but can only accommodate extensions on a space available basis and if visas regulations allow for it. Therefore it's best for students to apply for the academic year from the beginning (if their academic plan can allow for it) in order to hold their space in that program and in order to secure a visa if necessary. Students who have only attended one semester tell us time and time again that they wished they had stayed the full academic year.
Model response: Should I apply for one semester or a year? 
The decision to apply for one semester or a year depends on your situation. If you are in your junior or senior year of high school, then you should apply for a year. If you are a freshman, then you should apply for a semester. 
Can I apply for a year if I am a junior or senior in high school?
No, you must be a junior or senior in high school to apply for a year. 
Do I need to have a 3.0 GPA to apply for a year?
No, you do not need to have a 3.0 GPA to apply for a year. 
How long does it take to process my application?
The application process usually takes 2-3 weeks to process.

Question: Should I have other study abroad locations in mind when I apply?
Ideal response: Yes! Due to space constraints, our programs cannot always accommodate all applicants. Historically, about 2 out of 3 students who apply are admitted to their first choice program. Therefore we ask students to be open to multiple locations and apply by the priority deadline for the greatest chance of admission.
Model response: Should I have other study abroad locations in mind when I apply? I am thinking about the location of the study abroad program.
Does the study abroad program have a location that I would like to go to?
What is the difference between a study abroad program and a semester abroad?
Is it possible to apply to the study abroad program when I am already enrolled in a degree program?

Question: Can I apply for more than one program?
Ideal response: Students have the option to be considered for up to six programs and terms with one application. Students will be considered for their first choice first, then their second choice, etc. Programs and terms that have reached capacity will not be available as an alternate choice. Programs that require an interview or audition, such as Faculty-led, internship, and language-intensive programs will not be available as an alternate choice.
Model response: Can I apply for more than one program? 
Yes, you can.
