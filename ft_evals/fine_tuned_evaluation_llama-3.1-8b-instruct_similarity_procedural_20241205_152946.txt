Question: What is the grade dispute process? 
Ideal response: 
This policy outlines the procedure that a student must follow in the event that he/she wishes to dispute the grade
received in a course at Seaver College.


This process must be initiated by the student before the midpoint of the next non-summer semester, which
immediately follows the course in question.


Most grade issues can and should be resolved privately between the student and instructor. This is the starting
point with all grade disputes. In case the matter is not satisfactorily resolved by these means, the following appeals
procedure shall apply:


1. The student shall submit a written appeal to the division dean with a copy to the instructor identifying the
course, semester, grade received, and the reason for the appeal.
2. The student shall assemble all relevant class materials (syllabi, returned assignments, tests, papers, etc.)
distributed or returned by the instructor to the student. These materials need to be compiled within two
weeks of the date of the written appeal. If the student cannot assemble all such documents, the grade dispute
is concluded with no grade change.
3. Concurrently, the instructor will assemble all relevant class materials that he or she retained for this student
(final exams, midterms, etc.) within two weeks of the date of the written appeal. A copy of these documents
along with the syllabus, grade book, and the instructor's written response to the student appeal is to be
forwarded by the instructor to the division dean. If the instructor cannot produce all relevant documents
pertinent to the student's work in the course, the grade dispute will be taken up by the instructor's division
dean in consultation with the associate dean.
4. The chair will appoint an ad hoc committee of two faculty members within the division who teach the course
(or a similar one) in question. This committee will then evaluate the student's course materials based on the
following criteria:


 Have all assignments and examinations been administered in accordance with the guidelines set forth in
the class syllabus?
 Has all student work been graded fairly, consistently, and accurately?
At the conclusion of the committee's evaluation of the course material, it will submit a written recommendation
and explanation to the division dean. The recommendation must be one of the following:


1. Uphold the grade given by the instructor, or
2. Require that the instructor re-grade one or more assignments, followed by a recalculation of the student's
grade, or
3. Require that the instructor formulate a repeat of one or more class assignments or assessments, followed by
a recalculation of the student's grade, or
4. Recommend a specified grade change


Based on the ad hoc committee's findings, it shall be the division dean's decision, in consultation with the
associate dean of Seaver College, as to whether the grade shall be changed. This decision will be final. No further
appeal is possible.
Model response: What is the grade dispute process? 2023-03-09T14:19:44-05:00
The grade dispute process is a formal procedure that allows students to contest a grade they feel is unfair or inaccurate. Here’s a general overview of the process:
1. Initial Contact: The student meets with the instructor to discuss their concerns about the grade. This is often the most effective way to resolve the issue, as the instructor may have misunderstood the student’s work or may have been able to clarify any misunderstandings.
2. Written Request: If the issue is not resolved through the initial meeting, the student may submit a written request to the instructor to review their grade. This request should include a clear explanation of the reason for the dispute and any relevant evidence or supporting

Question: I'm a student with a disability. How do I apply for accomodations?
Ideal response: Step One
Complete an online inquiry to begin the process of applying for accommodations.
Step Two
After completing the online inquiry, students will receive the following in an email to guide them in providing appropriate documentation. Students should upload said documentation to their file through Wavenet (instructions will be in the email):
Documentation/Pepperdine Accessibility Form: The Pepperdine Accessibility Form is a tool that students may use to provide guidance to medical or psychological professionals regarding the information needed to complete the file. Please choose the form(s) most appropriate to your needs. There are two types of Pepperdine Accessibility Forms including:
Pepperdine Accessibility Form - Initial form
Housing and ESA Addendum - To be submitted (in addition to the Pepperdine Accessibility Form) for housing and esa requests
Guidelines for Documentation of a Disability: This is a comprehensive guide to the information needed to complete the file. For students seeking accommodations for ADD or for a learning disability, the OSA requests additional documentation to the disability verification form (this information is listed in the guidelines).
Accommodation letters should be included in the documentation submitted for those who have received prior accommodations in high school, other undergraduate or graduate institutions, or on the ACT/SAT/GMAT/LSAT etc.
Step Three
Once you have submitted the documentation, OSA will be notified through the Accommodate System.  OSA will send you a scheduling link to your Pepperdine email to arrange a conversation with an Accessibility Specialist.  Please be on the lookout for the scheduling link.
This conversation is designed to give the directors a narrative about a student's disability and the barriers it presents to their education. The student and specialist will together discern how Pepperdine can best support the student.
In most cases, students may expect a written communication from OSA within five to ten business days of meeting with the Accessibility Specialist.  This communication will include either an accommodation decision, a request for more information, or instructions on next steps.  Students choose with whom to share this letter. Accommodations will not be offered until a letter is presented to professors or appropriate staff.
Model response: I'm a student with a disability. How do I apply for accomodations? 
To apply for accommodations, please follow these steps:
  1. Contact the Disability Services Office (DSO) to schedule an appointment with a Disability Services Coordinator.
  2. During the appointment, you will complete a Disability Disclosure Form, which is a confidential document that outlines your disability and any necessary accommodations.
  3. The Disability Services Coordinator will review your documentation and discuss your accommodations with you.
  4. You will receive an email with information on how to register for your accommodations through our online portal, WebAdvisor.
  5. Once you register for your accommodations, you will receive an email with instructions on how to access your accommodations.
  6. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate

Question: How can I request a refund?
Ideal response: Refunds from federal aid will be processed automatically at the start of each term. You do not need to do anything other than make sure you have a valid eRefund account set up about two weeks prior to the start of the term.

In order to expedite the process, we ask that you do not call the office regarding the status of your refund during the following times of the term: the week prior to the start of the term or the first two weeks of the term. 

Students may check their WaveNet account to see when the refund has been processed. It will show up in the "Refund" column under the Account Activity. Once on the student account, the funds will be released to the banks (for those with an eRefund) at the close of business the following day. It then takes generally 3-7 business days for the bank to deposit the funds into the bank account designated on the eRefund.

For refund requests on any other credit balance throughout the semester, students may contact the Office of Student Accounts by phone at (310) 506-8000 or using their Pepperdine email account, send an email to SeaverSA@pepperdine.edu. All requests for refunds must come from the student.
