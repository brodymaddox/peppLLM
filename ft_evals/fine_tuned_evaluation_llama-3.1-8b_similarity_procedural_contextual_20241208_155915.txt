Question: Should I apply for one semester or a year?
Ideal response: Many students who choose to study abroad for one semester later ask to extend their contract to remain abroad for a longer period of time. We accommodate these students when possible, but can only accommodate extensions on a space available basis and if visas regulations allow for it. Therefore it's best for students to apply for the academic year from the beginning (if their academic plan can allow for it) in order to hold their space in that program and in order to secure a visa if necessary. Students who have only attended one semester tell us time and time again that they wished they had stayed the full academic year.

Question: Why are priority applications due about a month after the beginning of the fall semester?
Ideal response: Prior to going on a semester or Academic Year International Program, students are required to take the first level of a language class (151) for all fall and spring programs (except Washington, D.C. and London programs), as well as other prerequisite courses prior to attending their international program. Students will register for these spring classes in early to mid-November. Due to this registration timeline, International Programs has created an application process and timeline to review students, give them a decision, and leave enough time for them to review their contracts and commit to the program prior to the November registration dates. This allows students to register in the appropriate classes before going abroad, so that they can complete all necessary prerequisites.
Model response: Why are priority applications due about a month after the beginning of the fall semester? Why not earlier? Or later?
The priority application deadline is set so that we have a better idea of how many students will be coming to campus and how many housing units will be needed. It is also set so that we can get students into housing as soon as possible. If we received applications earlier, we would not know how many students would be coming to campus and we would not be able to offer housing to students. If we received applications later, we would not be able to get students into housing until after the fall semester had started, which would be inconvenient for students.
Why are applications due so early?
The application process for on-campus housing is a lengthy process. We have to contact the students who applied to see if they still want to

Question: What is the grade dispute process? 
Ideal response: 
This policy outlines the procedure that a student must follow in the event that he/she wishes to dispute the grade
received in a course at Seaver College.


This process must be initiated by the student before the midpoint of the next non-summer semester, which
immediately follows the course in question.


Most grade issues can and should be resolved privately between the student and instructor. This is the starting
point with all grade disputes. In case the matter is not satisfactorily resolved by these means, the following appeals
procedure shall apply:


1. The student shall submit a written appeal to the division dean with a copy to the instructor identifying the
course, semester, grade received, and the reason for the appeal.
2. The student shall assemble all relevant class materials (syllabi, returned assignments, tests, papers, etc.)
distributed or returned by the instructor to the student. These materials need to be compiled within two
weeks of the date of the written appeal. If the student cannot assemble all such documents, the grade dispute
is concluded with no grade change.
3. Concurrently, the instructor will assemble all relevant class materials that he or she retained for this student
(final exams, midterms, etc.) within two weeks of the date of the written appeal. A copy of these documents
along with the syllabus, grade book, and the instructor's written response to the student appeal is to be
forwarded by the instructor to the division dean. If the instructor cannot produce all relevant documents
pertinent to the student's work in the course, the grade dispute will be taken up by the instructor's division
dean in consultation with the associate dean.
4. The chair will appoint an ad hoc committee of two faculty members within the division who teach the course
(or a similar one) in question. This committee will then evaluate the student's course materials based on the
following criteria:


 Have all assignments and examinations been administered in accordance with the guidelines set forth in
the class syllabus?
 Has all student work been graded fairly, consistently, and accurately?
At the conclusion of the committee's evaluation of the course material, it will submit a written recommendation
and explanation to the division dean. The recommendation must be one of the following:


1. Uphold the grade given by the instructor, or
2. Require that the instructor re-grade one or more assignments, followed by a recalculation of the student's
grade, or
3. Require that the instructor formulate a repeat of one or more class assignments or assessments, followed by
a recalculation of the student's grade, or
4. Recommend a specified grade change


Based on the ad hoc committee's findings, it shall be the division dean's decision, in consultation with the
associate dean of Seaver College, as to whether the grade shall be changed. This decision will be final. No further
appeal is possible.
Model response: What is the grade dispute process?  The grade dispute process is the process by which a student may appeal a final grade.  The grade dispute process is a three-step process:
  1. The student must first meet with the instructor to discuss the grade and try to resolve the dispute.  If the instructor and student cannot resolve the dispute, the student may complete the Grade Dispute Form and submit it to the instructor within 15 days of the posting of the grade.  The form may be found on the Registrar's website.
  2. The instructor will respond to the Grade Dispute Form within 15 days of receiving it.
  3. If the instructor and student cannot resolve the dispute, the student may appeal to the Academic Standards Committee.

Question: How do parking permits work?
Ideal response: Enter the vehicle information and purchase a parking permit in the parking portal website.
License Plate Recognition (LPR) cameras scan license plates of vehicles entering and parking on campus. Using a mobile, hand-held, or vehicle-mounted system, they will scan license plates one vehicle and one area at a time.
The system will identify unregistered vehicles or parked in an unauthorized location. Enforcement officers will determine whether to issue a citation when the system identifies a vehicle that does not have a permit or has the incorrect permit for the parking space.
Physical permits allow for easy idenfication of registered community members.
Model response: How do parking permits work? How can I get one?
A parking permit is required to park in the lots designated for permit holders.

A parking permit is not required to park in the parking lots designated for non-permit holders. To purchase a parking permit, visit the Parking Services website.

Question: I'm a student with a disability. How do I apply for accomodations?
Ideal response: Step One
Complete an online inquiry to begin the process of applying for accommodations.
Step Two
After completing the online inquiry, students will receive the following in an email to guide them in providing appropriate documentation. Students should upload said documentation to their file through Wavenet (instructions will be in the email):
Documentation/Pepperdine Accessibility Form: The Pepperdine Accessibility Form is a tool that students may use to provide guidance to medical or psychological professionals regarding the information needed to complete the file. Please choose the form(s) most appropriate to your needs. There are two types of Pepperdine Accessibility Forms including:
Pepperdine Accessibility Form - Initial form
Housing and ESA Addendum - To be submitted (in addition to the Pepperdine Accessibility Form) for housing and esa requests
Guidelines for Documentation of a Disability: This is a comprehensive guide to the information needed to complete the file. For students seeking accommodations for ADD or for a learning disability, the OSA requests additional documentation to the disability verification form (this information is listed in the guidelines).
Accommodation letters should be included in the documentation submitted for those who have received prior accommodations in high school, other undergraduate or graduate institutions, or on the ACT/SAT/GMAT/LSAT etc.
Step Three
Once you have submitted the documentation, OSA will be notified through the Accommodate System.  OSA will send you a scheduling link to your Pepperdine email to arrange a conversation with an Accessibility Specialist.  Please be on the lookout for the scheduling link.
This conversation is designed to give the directors a narrative about a student's disability and the barriers it presents to their education. The student and specialist will together discern how Pepperdine can best support the student.
In most cases, students may expect a written communication from OSA within five to ten business days of meeting with the Accessibility Specialist.  This communication will include either an accommodation decision, a request for more information, or instructions on next steps.  Students choose with whom to share this letter. Accommodations will not be offered until a letter is presented to professors or appropriate staff.
Model response: I'm a student with a disability. How do I apply for accomodations? 
Students with disabilities may request accommodations through the Office of Disability Services. To apply for accommodations, please contact the Office of Disability Services at 919.760.6123 or  disabilityservices@uncg.edu.

Question: How can I request a refund?
Ideal response: Refunds from federal aid will be processed automatically at the start of each term. You do not need to do anything other than make sure you have a valid eRefund account set up about two weeks prior to the start of the term.

In order to expedite the process, we ask that you do not call the office regarding the status of your refund during the following times of the term: the week prior to the start of the term or the first two weeks of the term. 

Students may check their WaveNet account to see when the refund has been processed. It will show up in the "Refund" column under the Account Activity. Once on the student account, the funds will be released to the banks (for those with an eRefund) at the close of business the following day. It then takes generally 3-7 business days for the bank to deposit the funds into the bank account designated on the eRefund.

For refund requests on any other credit balance throughout the semester, students may contact the Office of Student Accounts by phone at (310) 506-8000 or using their Pepperdine email account, send an email to SeaverSA@pepperdine.edu. All requests for refunds must come from the student.
