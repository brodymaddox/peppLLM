I am not sure what the American Experience/American History GE requirement is, so I'm not sure what to do. 

The American Experience/American History GE requirement is satisfied by taking a course that is either an American History course or an American Experience course.  The courses that satisfy the American Experience requirement are: POSC 105, POSC 201, POSC 203, POSC 301, and POSC 303.  The courses that satisfy the American History requirement are: HIST 201, HIST 203, HIST 205, HIST 301, and HIST 303. 

Since POSC 105 satisfies the American Experience requirement, and HIST 205 satisfies the American History requirement,
