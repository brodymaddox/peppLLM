Question: Should I apply for one semester or a year?
Ideal response: Many students who choose to study abroad for one semester later ask to extend their contract to remain abroad for a longer period of time. We accommodate these students when possible, but can only accommodate extensions on a space available basis and if visas regulations allow for it. Therefore it's best for students to apply for the academic year from the beginning (if their academic plan can allow for it) in order to hold their space in that program and in order to secure a visa if necessary. Students who have only attended one semester tell us time and time again that they wished they had stayed the full academic year.
Model response: Should I apply for one semester or a year? If I apply for one semester, I can only take one course and I won’t be able to attend the summer program. If I apply for a year, I can take two courses and attend the summer program, but it will be more expensive.

Question: Should I have other study abroad locations in mind when I apply?
Ideal response: Yes! Due to space constraints, our programs cannot always accommodate all applicants. Historically, about 2 out of 3 students who apply are admitted to their first choice program. Therefore we ask students to be open to multiple locations and apply by the priority deadline for the greatest chance of admission.
Model response: Should I have other study abroad locations in mind when I apply? 
It’s a good idea to have a few locations in mind when you apply to the program. This will give you a better idea of the different options available and will also make it easier to make a decision when you receive your acceptance letter. 
That being said, the first choice should be the location you are most interested in. If you are unsure about the program or the location, it’s okay to have multiple locations in mind, but make sure to clearly indicate your first choice in your application. 
If you have multiple locations in mind, you should also consider the following:
1.  Program availability: Some locations may have limited program availability, so it’s essential to have a backup location in mind.
2.  Cost:

Question: Can I apply for more than one program?
Ideal response: Students have the option to be considered for up to six programs and terms with one application. Students will be considered for their first choice first, then their second choice, etc. Programs and terms that have reached capacity will not be available as an alternate choice. Programs that require an interview or audition, such as Faculty-led, internship, and language-intensive programs will not be available as an alternate choice.
Model response: Can I apply for more than one program? Yes, you can apply for more than one program. You will need to submit a separate application for each program, and you will need to pay the application fee for each program. However, you can use the same supporting documents (e.g. transcripts, letters of recommendation, etc.) for each application.
What is the deadline for the application? The deadline for the application is January 15th for fall admission and October 1st for spring admission. It is recommended that you submit your application by December 1st to ensure that it is reviewed by the Admissions Committee before the deadline.
Do I need to submit a personal statement or essay? Yes, you are required to submit a personal statement or essay as part of your application. This is

Other positions are also available once in your program. Program directors will be reaching out to students the first month of the program
Model response: Are there jobs for students while abroad? 
Yes, there are jobs for students while abroad, but they can be challenging to find. Many countries have restrictions on hiring international students, and some employers may be hesitant to hire students who will only be in the country for a short time. However, there are some options to consider:
Internships: Many companies offer internships to students who are studying abroad. These internships can provide valuable work experience and can be a great way to build your professional network.
Teaching English: If you are studying in a non-English speaking country, you may be able to find work as an English teacher. This can be a great way to earn money and improve your language skills.

Question: Why are priority applications due about a month after the beginning of the fall semester?
Ideal response: Prior to going on a semester or Academic Year International Program, students are required to take the first level of a language class (151) for all fall and spring programs (except Washington, D.C. and London programs), as well as other prerequisite courses prior to attending their international program. Students will register for these spring classes in early to mid-November. Due to this registration timeline, International Programs has created an application process and timeline to review students, give them a decision, and leave enough time for them to review their contracts and commit to the program prior to the November registration dates. This allows students to register in the appropriate classes before going abroad, so that they can complete all necessary prerequisites.
Model response: Why are priority applications due about a month after the beginning of the fall semester? Why can't they be due in the summer?
Priority applications are due about a month after the beginning of the fall semester because that is when the majority of students are back on campus, and our staff is back in the office. This allows us to review applications and conduct interviews in a timely manner.
Summer deadlines are not feasible for several reasons:
1. Many students are not on campus during the summer, which makes it difficult for them to meet with us or provide necessary documents.
2. Our staff is reduced during the summer, which means we have fewer people available to review applications.
3. The summer is a busy time for many students, who are often working, studying abroad, or participating in internships. They may not have the time or

Model response: Who teaches the courses in International Programs? 
Courses in International Programs are taught by the same faculty who teach in the regular undergraduate and graduate programs at the University of Colorado Boulder.

Question: What does it mean if I was waitlisted for a program and what should I do?
Ideal response: Due to space constraints and other factors, we often cannot accept all applicants for a given program. Students placed on the waitlist may choose to remain on the waitlist for the chance to be admitted at a later date if space becomes available, or they may choose to reapply for an alternate program, as long as that program is accepting new applications. Click here for more information.
Model response: What does it mean if I was waitlisted for a program and what should I do? 
When you are waitlisted for a program, it means that the admissions committee has considered your application, but they do not have enough space in the program to offer you a spot. You are still considered a viable candidate, and your application is being kept in consideration. However, your chances of being admitted are lower than those of the accepted candidates.
Here are some steps you can take if you are waitlisted:
1. Respond promptly: The admissions committee will typically send a waitlist notification with instructions on how to respond. It's essential to follow these instructions and respond promptly to show your continued interest in the program.
2. Submit additional information: If the admissions committee asks for additional information, such as a statement or letters of recommendation, be sure
