Question: Should I apply for one semester or a year?
Ideal response: Many students who choose to study abroad for one semester later ask to extend their contract to remain abroad for a longer period of time. We accommodate these students when possible, but can only accommodate extensions on a space available basis and if visas regulations allow for it. Therefore it's best for students to apply for the academic year from the beginning (if their academic plan can allow for it) in order to hold their space in that program and in order to secure a visa if necessary. Students who have only attended one semester tell us time and time again that they wished they had stayed the full academic year.
Model response: Should I apply for one semester or a year? That is a great question! Here are some things to consider when deciding whether to apply for one semester or a year:
Semester Application:
Pros of a semester application:
You can take a course or two and test the waters without committing to a full year.
It can be a great way to gain international experience without having to take a full year off from your studies.
You can use the semester abroad as a stepping stone to a longer-term program, such as a year abroad.
Cons of a semester application:
You may not have as many course options available to you as you would with a year-long program.
You may not be able to take as many credits as you would with a year-long program.
You may have to apply for a student visa
Similarity score: 0.7016177177429199
--------------------
Question: Should I have other study abroad locations in mind when I apply?
Ideal response: Yes! Due to space constraints, our programs cannot always accommodate all applicants. Historically, about 2 out of 3 students who apply are admitted to their first choice program. Therefore we ask students to be open to multiple locations and apply by the priority deadline for the greatest chance of admission.
Model response: Should I have other study abroad locations in mind when I apply? 
Yes, it's a good idea to have other study abroad locations in mind when you apply. Here's why:
1. Flexibility: Having multiple options can give you flexibility in case your first choice doesn't work out. This might be due to various reasons such as visa issues, program availability, or personal preferences.
2. Back-up plans: Having a back-up plan can reduce stress and anxiety. If you don't get accepted into your first choice, you'll have a plan B to fall back on.
3. Increased chances of acceptance: If you apply to multiple programs, you may increase your chances of getting accepted into one of them. This is especially true if you're applying to programs with similar requirements and deadlines.
4. Personal

Question: Can I apply for more than one program?
Ideal response: Students have the option to be considered for up to six programs and terms with one application. Students will be considered for their first choice first, then their second choice, etc. Programs and terms that have reached capacity will not be available as an alternate choice. Programs that require an interview or audition, such as Faculty-led, internship, and language-intensive programs will not be available as an alternate choice.
Model response: Can I apply for more than one program? Yes, you can apply to multiple programs. However, you will need to submit a separate application for each program. The application fee is non-refundable, so please make sure you are applying to the correct programs before submitting your applications.
Do I need to submit an English proficiency test? If your native language is not English, you will need to submit an English proficiency test (TOEFL or IELTS) as part of your application. The test results are valid for two years from the date of the test. Please see the English Proficiency Test Requirements for more information.

Question: Why are priority applications due about a month after the beginning of the fall semester?
Ideal response: Prior to going on a semester or Academic Year International Program, students are required to take the first level of a language class (151) for all fall and spring programs (except Washington, D.C. and London programs), as well as other prerequisite courses prior to attending their international program. Students will register for these spring classes in early to mid-November. Due to this registration timeline, International Programs has created an application process and timeline to review students, give them a decision, and leave enough time for them to review their contracts and commit to the program prior to the November registration dates. This allows students to register in the appropriate classes before going abroad, so that they can complete all necessary prerequisites.
Model response: Why are priority applications due about a month after the beginning of the fall semester? 
The priority application deadline is set about a month after the start of the fall semester because it is a time when many students are still deciding on their college plans. The deadline is set after the start of the semester so that students have a chance to finalize their plans and apply to their top choices. The priority deadline is also a time when students are typically taking the SAT or ACT, and the scores from these tests are usually available around this time. This allows students to submit their scores with their application.
In addition, the priority deadline is a time when many students are receiving acceptance letters from colleges and universities, and they may need to make a decision about which college to attend. The priority deadline allows students to submit their application and supporting materials, such

Question: What does it mean if I was waitlisted for a program and what should I do?
Ideal response: Due to space constraints and other factors, we often cannot accept all applicants for a given program.

Model response: What does it mean if I was waitlisted for a program and what should I do? 
A waitlist is a list of applicants who have not been accepted or denied into a program.

1. Respond to the waitlist notification: If you receive a waitlist notification, it is essential to respond to the admissions committee as soon as possible. This shows that you are still interested in the program and willing to wait.
