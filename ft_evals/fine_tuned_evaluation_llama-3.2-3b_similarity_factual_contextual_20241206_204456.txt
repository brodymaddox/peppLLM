Is it fair to turn away a student who does not have a car? Is it fair to turn away a student from out of state? Is it fair to turn away a student who has been on the waitlist for a long time?

Question: Should I apply for one semester or a year?
Ideal response: Many students who choose to study abroad for one semester later ask to extend their contract to remain abroad for a longer period of time. We accommodate these students when possible, but can only accommodate extensions on a space available basis and if visas regulations allow for it. Therefore it's best for students to apply for the academic year from the beginning (if their academic plan can allow for it) in order to hold their space in that program and in order to secure a visa if necessary. Students who have only attended one semester tell us time and time again that they wished they had stayed the full academic year.

Question: Should I have other study abroad locations in mind when I apply?
Ideal response: Yes! Due to space constraints, our programs cannot always accommodate all applicants. Historically, about 2 out of 3 students who apply are admitted to their first choice program. Therefore we ask students to be open to multiple locations and apply by the priority deadline for the greatest chance of admission.
Model response: Should I have other study abroad locations in mind when I apply? Will I be able to attend the program I want if I don't have other locations in mind?
Yes! We encourage you to think about other study abroad programs you may be interested in while you are in the application process.

Question: Why are priority applications due about a month after the beginning of the fall semester?
Ideal response: Prior to going on a semester or Academic Year International Program, students are required to take the first level of a language class (151) for all fall and spring programs (except Washington, D.C. and London programs), as well as other prerequisite courses prior to attending their international program. Students will register for these spring classes in early to mid-November. Due to this registration timeline, International Programs has created an application process and timeline to review students, give them a decision, and leave enough time for them to review their contracts and commit to the program prior to the November registration dates. This allows students to register in the appropriate classes before going abroad, so that they can complete all necessary prerequisites.
Model response: Why are priority applications due about a month after the beginning of the fall semester? Why not have priority applications due at the same time as the beginning of the fall semester?
Priority applications are due by the end of the first week of the fall semester. This is because we want to give our applicants the best chance at being admitted by the end of the fall semester, so that they can make decisions about whether or not to enroll for the following academic year.
If you’re not accepted for the fall semester, you can still apply for the following academic year.
