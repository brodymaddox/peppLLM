Question: Should I apply for one semester or a year?
Ideal response: Many students who choose to study abroad for one semester later ask to extend their contract to remain abroad for a longer period of time. We accommodate these students when possible, but can only accommodate extensions on a space available basis and if visas regulations allow for it. Therefore it's best for students to apply for the academic year from the beginning (if their academic plan can allow for it) in order to hold their space in that program and in order to secure a visa if necessary. Students who have only attended one semester tell us time and time again that they wished they had stayed the full academic year.
Model response: Should I apply for one semester or a year??
If you're considering applying to a university in the US, here are some factors to consider when deciding whether to apply for one semester or a year:

**Pros of applying for one semester:**

1.  **Cost:** Applying for one semester can be cheaper than applying for a full year.
2.  **Flexibility:** You can take a gap year or travel before returning to university.
3.  **Academic focus:** You can focus on a specific major or program for one semester before deciding if it's the right fit.

**Cons of applying for one semester:**

1.  **Limited time:** You may not have enough time to fully immerse yourself in the program.
2.  **Financial aid:** You may not

--------------------
Question: Should I have other study abroad locations in mind when I apply?
Ideal response: Yes! Due to space constraints, our programs cannot always accommodate all applicants. Historically, about 2 out of 3 students who apply are admitted to their first choice program. Therefore we ask students to be open to multiple locations and apply by the priority deadline for the greatest chance of admission.
Model response: Should I have other study abroad locations in mind when I apply? 
Yes, you should have other study abroad locations in mind when you apply. 
While there is no limit to the number of locations you can apply to, it is recommended to have a maximum of 3-4 locations in mind when you apply. 
Having too many locations can make it difficult for the study abroad office to match you with a program that is a good fit for you. 

Here are some tips to keep in mind when selecting locations: 

1.  Consider your academic and career goals: 
    *   Are you interested in pursuing a degree in a specific field? 
    *   Do you want to gain experience in a particular industry? 
    *   Are you looking to specialize in a particular area?

Programs that require an interview or audition, such as Faculty-led, internship, and language-intensive programs will not be available as an alternate choice.
Model response: Can I apply for more than one program? 
Yes, you can apply for more than one program. However, please note that you must submit separate applications for each program and meet the specific requirements for each program.
Can I apply for a program if I have not completed my degree?
Yes, some programs may allow you to apply even if you have not completed your degree. However, the program may have specific requirements or prerequisites that you must meet before you can be accepted.
Can I apply for a program if I have a grade below 70%?
Most programs require a minimum GPA of 70% or higher. If your GPA is below 70%, you may still be considered for admission, but you may need to provide additional documentation or meet specific requirements to be eligible.

Question: Why are priority applications due about a month after the beginning of the fall semester?
Ideal response: Prior to going on a semester or Academic Year International Program, students are required to take the first level of a language class (151) for all fall and spring programs (except Washington, D.C. and London programs), as well as other prerequisite courses prior to attending their international program. Students will register for these spring classes in early to mid-November. Due to this registration timeline, International Programs has created an application process and timeline to review students, give them a decision, and leave enough time for them to review their contracts and commit to the program prior to the November registration dates. This allows students to register in the appropriate classes before going abroad, so that they can complete all necessary prerequisites.
Model response: Why are priority applications due about a month after the beginning of the fall semester??
Priority applications are due about a month after the beginning of the fall semester because the admissions committee needs time to review and process all the applications before the end of the semester. This allows them to make a more informed decision about which students to admit, as they can review all the applications and make comparisons between students. Additionally, the committee needs time to finalize the admissions decisions and notify students of their admission status.

Question: What does it mean if I was waitlisted for a program and what should I do?
Ideal response: Due to space constraints and other factors, we often cannot accept all applicants for a given program. Students placed on the waitlist may choose to remain on the waitlist for the chance to be admitted at a later date if space becomes available, or they may choose to reapply for an alternate program, as long as that program is accepting new applications. Click here for more information.
Model response: What does it mean if I was waitlisted for a program and what should I do? 
If you're waitlisted for a program, it means that you've been placed on a list of applicants who are being considered for admission to the program, but you haven't been accepted yet. The decision to admit you to the program is usually made after the priority deadlines have passed, and the program has a limited number of available seats.

Here are some steps you can take if you're waitlisted for a program:

1.  **Don't panic**: Waitlisting is a common practice, and it doesn't necessarily mean that you won't be admitted.

The contract is a legally binding document that details your responsibilities as an IP student, so make sure you read it carefully and have consulted your family, healthcare providers, academic and financial aid advisors, etc. before signing. Once you have signed a contract, if you need to withdraw for any reason in the future, financial penalties as detailed in the contract apply.

Model response: What is the grade point scale?  The grade point scale is a way of measuring the quality of student performance.  It is based on a 4.0 scale, with 4.0 being the highest.  The grade point scale is divided into the following grades:
A (4.0)
B (3.0)
C (2.0)
D (1.0)
F (0.0)
The grade point scale is used to determine the student's grade point average (GPA).  A student's GPA is calculated by multiplying the grade point for each course by the number of credits in the course and adding the results.  The student's total GPA is then divided by the total number of credits earned.

Question: What is the grade dispute process? 
Ideal response: 
This policy outlines the procedure that a student must follow in the event that he/she wishes to dispute the grade
received in a course at Seaver College.


This process must be initiated by the student before the midpoint of the next non-summer semester, which
immediately follows the course in question.


Most grade issues can and should be resolved privately between the student and instructor. This is the starting
point with all grade disputes. In case the matter is not satisfactorily resolved by these means, the following appeals
procedure shall apply:


1. The student shall submit a written appeal to the division dean with a copy to the instructor identifying the
course, semester, grade received, and the reason for the appeal.
2. The student shall assemble all relevant class materials (syllabi, returned assignments, tests, papers, etc.)
distributed or returned by the instructor to the student. These materials need to be compiled within two
weeks of the date of the written appeal. If the student cannot assemble all such documents, the grade dispute
is concluded with no grade change.
3. Concurrently, the instructor will assemble all relevant class materials that he or she retained for this student
(final exams, midterms, etc.) within two weeks of the date of the written appeal. A copy of these documents
along with the syllabus, grade book, and the instructor's written response to the student appeal is to be
forwarded by the instructor to the division dean. If the instructor cannot produce all relevant documents
pertinent to the student's work in the course, the grade dispute will be taken up by the instructor's division
dean in consultation with the associate dean.
4. The chair will appoint an ad hoc committee of two faculty members within the division who teach the course
(or a similar one) in question. This committee will then evaluate the student's course materials based on the
following criteria:


 Have all assignments and examinations been administered in accordance with the guidelines set forth in
the class syllabus?
 Has all student work been graded fairly, consistently, and accurately?
At the conclusion of the committee's evaluation of the course material, it will submit a written recommendation
and explanation to the division dean. The recommendation must be one of the following:


1. Uphold the grade given by the instructor, or
2. Require that the instructor re-grade one or more assignments, followed by a recalculation of the student's
grade, or
3. Require that the instructor formulate a repeat of one or more class assignments or assessments, followed by
a recalculation of the student's grade, or
4. Recommend a specified grade change


Based on the ad hoc committee's findings, it shall be the division dean's decision, in consultation with the
associate dean of Seaver College, as to whether the grade shall be changed. This decision will be final. No further
appeal is possible.
Model response: What is the grade dispute process?  (For students)

Question: How do I get a passport?
Ideal response: All students studying abroad with International Programs, including students studying in Washington, D.C., must have a valid passport. Passports must be valid for at least 6 months past the student's anticipated return date, per airline policy. Students applying to go abroad should immediately begin renewing or applying for a passport. Visit the US Department of State's Passport Services website for more information such as passport offices nationwide, passport applications, and passport renewals. Refer to our passport page for more information. 

Students who are required to obtain a visa and who are planning on traveling internationally before their departure may be asked to obtain a second passport. Additional information will be sent to students after admission.

Question: How do I extend my stay overseas and what are flight implications?
Ideal response: Students can request to extend the return date of their flight at the time of booking, to facilitate personal travel. Detailed instructions on flight bookings will be provided to students as part of their preparation process. 

Students that have already booked their flight with Corniche Travel and would like to adjust their travel dates should contact Corniche Travel by emailing pepperdinetravel@corniche.com or by calling (310) 854-6000. Be sure to include details of your request in the email.

Students must ensure that lengthening their stay does not impact their immigration status. Not all flights can be changed. The flight route (departure and arrival locations) cannot be changed. Departure dates cannot usually be changed.

Students are responsible for any paying associated change fees (usually ranging from $50 - $500, depending on the airline) and any increases in airfare.

Question: I'm a student with a disability. How do I apply for accomodations?
Ideal response: Step One
Complete an online inquiry to begin the process of applying for accommodations.
Step Two
After completing the online inquiry, students will receive the following in an email to guide them in providing appropriate documentation. Students should upload said documentation to their file through Wavenet (instructions will be in the email):
Documentation/Pepperdine Accessibility Form: The Pepperdine Accessibility Form is a tool that students may use to provide guidance to medical or psychological professionals regarding the information needed to complete the file. Please choose the form(s) most appropriate to your needs. There are two types of Pepperdine Accessibility Forms including:
Pepperdine Accessibility Form - Initial form
Housing and ESA Addendum - To be submitted (in addition to the Pepperdine Accessibility Form) for housing and esa requests
Guidelines for Documentation of a Disability: This is a comprehensive guide to the information needed to complete the file. For students seeking accommodations for ADD or for a learning disability, the OSA requests additional documentation to the disability verification form (this information is listed in the guidelines).
Accommodation letters should be included in the documentation submitted for those who have received prior accommodations in high school, other undergraduate or graduate institutions, or on the ACT/SAT/GMAT/LSAT etc.
Step Three
Once you have submitted the documentation, OSA will be notified through the Accommodate System.  OSA will send you a scheduling link to your Pepperdine email to arrange a conversation with an Accessibility Specialist.  Please be on the lookout for the scheduling link.
This conversation is designed to give the directors a narrative about a student's disability and the barriers it presents to their education. The student and specialist will together discern how Pepperdine can best support the student.
In most cases, students may expect a written communication from OSA within five to ten business days of meeting with the Accessibility Specialist.  This communication will include either an accommodation decision, a request for more information, or instructions on next steps.  Students choose with whom to share this letter. Accommodations will not be offered until a letter is presented to professors or appropriate staff.
Model response: I'm a student with a disability. How do I apply for accomodations? 
The following steps will guide you through the application process for accommodations:

1.  **Contact the Disability Services Office (DSO)**: Reach out to the DSO at your institution to inquire about the application process and to request an appointment to discuss your needs.
2.  **Gather Required Documents**: Collect any relevant documents, such as:
    *   A letter from a medical professional (if you have a diagnosed medical condition)
    *   A letter from a mental health professional (if you have a diagnosed mental health condition)
    *   A letter from a licensed psychologist (if you have a diagnosed learning disability)

Ideal response: Refunds from federal aid will be processed automatically at the start of each term. You do not need to do anything other than make sure you have a valid eRefund account set up about two weeks prior to the start of the term.

In order to expedite the process, we ask that you do not call the office regarding the status of your refund during the following times of the term: the week prior to the start of the term or the first two weeks of the term. 

Students may check their WaveNet account to see when the refund has been processed. It will show up in the "Refund" column under the Account Activity. Once on the student account, the funds will be released to the banks (for those with an eRefund) at the close of business the following day. It then takes generally 3-7 business days for the bank to deposit the funds into the bank account designated on the eRefund.

For refund requests on any other credit balance throughout the semester, students may contact the Office of Student Accounts by phone at (310) 506-8000 or using their Pepperdine email account, send an email to SeaverSA@pepperdine.edu. All requests for refunds must come from the student.

Question: How do I obtain the 1098-T form? 
Ideal response: Download the instructions from Pepperdine's Student Accounts webpage. 
Model response: How do I obtain the 1098-T form?  The IRS requires that all educational institutions report the amount of qualified tuition and related expenses paid by students to the IRS.  The 1098-T form is a tax document that reports this information.
The 1098-T form is usually available to students by mid-January of each year.  However, if you are a student who has not yet enrolled in classes, you may not receive the 1098-T form until you enroll.  If you are a student who is currently enrolled in classes, you will receive the 1098-T form by mid-January of each year.  If you are a student who has not yet enrolled in classes, you may need to wait until you enroll to receive the 109
