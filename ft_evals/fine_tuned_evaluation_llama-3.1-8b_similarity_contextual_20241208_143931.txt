Question: Should I apply for one semester or a year?
Ideal response: Many students who choose to study abroad for one semester later ask to extend their contract to remain abroad for a longer period of time. We accommodate these students when possible, but can only accommodate extensions on a space available basis and if visas regulations allow for it. Therefore it's best for students to apply for the academic year from the beginning (if their academic plan can allow for it) in order to hold their space in that program and in order to secure a visa if necessary. Students who have only attended one semester tell us time and time again that they wished they had stayed the full academic year.
Model response: Should I apply for one semester or a year? Do I need to apply for a visa?
You should apply for a year, as it will be easier to get a visa for a year than for a semester. It is also cheaper to apply for a year. If you apply for a semester, you will have to apply for a visa again for the second semester.
You can apply for a visa for a year or a semester. If you apply for a year, you will have to apply for a visa again for the second semester.

Ideal response: Prior to going on a semester or Academic Year International Program, students are required to take the first level of a language class (151) for all fall and spring programs (except Washington, D.C. and London programs), as well as other prerequisite courses prior to attending their international program. Students will register for these spring classes in early to mid-November. Due to this registration timeline, International Programs has created an application process and timeline to review students, give them a decision, and leave enough time for them to review their contracts and commit to the program prior to the November registration dates. This allows students to register in the appropriate classes before going abroad, so that they can complete all necessary prerequisites.
Model response: Why are priority applications due about a month after the beginning of the fall semester? Why not the beginning of the spring semester?
The priority application deadline is set for the beginning of the fall semester because that is the beginning of the academic year. In order to be considered for the scholarship, you must have completed your FAFSA by the priority deadline. The FAFSA becomes available on October 1st of each year.
