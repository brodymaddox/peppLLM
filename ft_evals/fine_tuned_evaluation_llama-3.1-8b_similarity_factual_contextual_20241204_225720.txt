Question: Should I apply for one semester or a year?
Ideal response: Many students who choose to study abroad for one semester later ask to extend their contract to remain abroad for a longer period of time. We accommodate these students when possible, but can only accommodate extensions on a space available basis and if visas regulations allow for it. Therefore it's best for students to apply for the academic year from the beginning (if their academic plan can allow for it) in order to hold their space in that program and in order to secure a visa if necessary. Students who have only attended one semester tell us time and time again that they wished they had stayed the full academic year.

Question: Should I have other study abroad locations in mind when I apply?
Ideal response: Yes! Due to space constraints, our programs cannot always accommodate all applicants. Historically, about 2 out of 3 students who apply are admitted to their first choice program.

Model response: Should I have other study abroad locations in mind when I apply? Yes. You should have a second choice of location in mind, and if possible, a third choice as well. The application process is very competitive and we cannot guarantee that you will be accepted to your first choice location. We do not offer a waitlist, so if you are not accepted to your first choice, you must re-apply to another location. It is best to be prepared and have a back-up location in mind before you apply.
Can I apply to multiple locations? Yes. You may apply to up to three locations, but you must complete a separate application for each location. You will need to pay the $50 application fee for each location you apply to. You will be asked to rank your locations in order of preference, and

Question: Why are priority applications due about a month after the beginning of the fall semester?
Ideal response: Prior to going on a semester or Academic Year International Program, students are required to take the first level of a language class (151) for all fall and spring programs (except Washington, D.C. and London programs), as well as other prerequisite courses prior to attending their international program. Students will register for these spring classes in early to mid-November. Due to this registration timeline, International Programs has created an application process and timeline to review students, give them a decision, and leave enough time for them to review their contracts and commit to the program prior to the November registration dates. This allows students to register in the appropriate classes before going abroad, so that they can complete all necessary prerequisites.
