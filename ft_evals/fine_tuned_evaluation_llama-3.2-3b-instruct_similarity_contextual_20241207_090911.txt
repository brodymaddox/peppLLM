Question: Should I apply for one semester or a year?
Ideal response: Many students who choose to study abroad for one semester later ask to extend their contract to remain abroad for a longer period of time. We accommodate these students when possible, but can only accommodate extensions on a space available basis and if visas regulations allow for it. Therefore it's best for students to apply for the academic year from the beginning (if their academic plan can allow for it) in order to hold their space in that program and in order to secure a visa if necessary. Students who have only attended one semester tell us time and time again that they wished they had stayed the full academic year.

2.  **Academic goals**: Are you looking to complete a specific degree or certification program? A full-year program might be more beneficial.
3.  **Personal circumstances**: Do you have other commitments, such as work or family obligations? One semester may be more manageable.

Question: Why are priority applications due about a month after the beginning of the fall semester?
Ideal response: Prior to going on a semester or Academic Year International Program, students are required to take the first level of a language class (151) for all fall and spring programs (except Washington, D.C. and London programs), as well as other prerequisite courses prior to attending their international program. Students will register for these spring classes in early to mid-November. Due to this registration timeline, International Programs has created an application process and timeline to review students, give them a decision, and leave enough time for them to review their contracts and commit to the program prior to the November registration dates. This allows students to register in the appropriate classes before going abroad, so that they can complete all necessary prerequisites.
Model response: Why are priority applications due about a month after the beginning of the fall semester??
Priority applications are due about a month after the beginning of the fall semester because of the following reasons:

1.  **Summer Preparation**: Students typically spend the summer months before the fall semester reviewing and preparing for their courses, which includes reading assigned texts, taking practice exams, and attending summer programs or workshops. By giving students a month to prepare, they can ensure that they have a strong foundation in the material before submitting their priority applications.
2.  **Academic Advising**: Many colleges and universities offer academic advising sessions during the summer months, which helps students choose courses and plan their academic schedule for the upcoming semester. This advising process is crucial for students to ensure they are taking the right courses and meeting their academic goals.

    *   There were more applicants than available spots.
