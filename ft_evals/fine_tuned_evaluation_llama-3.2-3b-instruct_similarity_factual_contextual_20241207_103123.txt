Question: Should I apply for one semester or a year?
Ideal response: Many students who choose to study abroad for one semester later ask to extend their contract to remain abroad for a longer period of time. We accommodate these students when possible, but can only accommodate extensions on a space available basis and if visas regulations allow for it. Therefore it's best for students to apply for the academic year from the beginning (if their academic plan can allow for it) in order to hold their space in that program and in order to secure a visa if necessary. Students who have only attended one semester tell us time and time again that they wished they had stayed the full academic year.
Model response: Should I apply for one semester or a year??
It's a good question to ask yourself before making a decision. Here are some factors to consider:

*   **Academic goals**: If you're looking to take a specific course or get a head start on your degree, applying for a semester might be the better choice. However, if you want to take a break from academics or focus on personal development, a year might be more suitable.
*   **Financial situation**: Consider your financial resources and whether you can afford to take a year off. If you have a part-time job or other sources of income, you might be able to make ends meet. However, if you're relying on financial aid or scholarships, taking a year off might impact your eligibility.
*   **Personal circumstances**:

Question: Why are priority applications due about a month after the beginning of the fall semester?
Ideal response: Prior to going on a semester or Academic Year International Program, students are required to take the first level of a language class (151) for all fall and spring programs (except Washington, D.C. and London programs), as well as other prerequisite courses prior to attending their international program. Students will register for these spring classes in early to mid-November. Due to this registration timeline, International Programs has created an application process and timeline to review students, give them a decision, and leave enough time for them to review their contracts and commit to the program prior to the November registration dates. This allows students to register in the appropriate classes before going abroad, so that they can complete all necessary prerequisites.
Model response: Why are priority applications due about a month after the beginning of the fall semester??
Priority applications are due about a month after the beginning of the fall semester because the university needs time to review and process the applications before the semester begins. This allows the university to make decisions about admission and provide students with a timely response.

Additionally, the university may need to verify the information on the application, such as transcripts, test scores, and letters of recommendation, which can take some time. By setting a deadline about a month after the semester starts, the university can ensure that all necessary information is gathered and reviewed before the semester begins.

It's also worth noting that the university may want to give students who submit priority applications a head start on the semester, allowing them to register for classes and prepare for the upcoming semester.

Question: What does it mean if I was waitlisted for a program and what should I do?
Ideal response: Due to space constraints and other factors, we often cannot accept all applicants for a given program.

**Understanding the Waitlist:**

A waitlist is a list of applicants who have not been accepted into a program but are still being considered for admission. It's a way for the program to keep track of applicants who are still interested in attending, but may not have met all the admission requirements.

**Why was I waitlisted?**

You might have been waitlisted for several reasons:

1.  **Insufficient documentation**: You may have missed submitting required documents or didn't provide enough information.
