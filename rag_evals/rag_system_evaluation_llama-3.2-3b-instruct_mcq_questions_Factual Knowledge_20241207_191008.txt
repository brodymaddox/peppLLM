Answer: D 
To answer this question, I looked at the options provided and found that the correct answer is option D. The Pepperdine University catalog page for the political science major is listed as option D. I chose this answer because it is the most direct and relevant link to the political science curriculum. I did not choose option A because it is a PDF link that appears to be a general catalog page, while option B is not a real link. Option C is also not a real link, and option D is the most relevant and accurate answer. Therefore, the correct answer is option D.
