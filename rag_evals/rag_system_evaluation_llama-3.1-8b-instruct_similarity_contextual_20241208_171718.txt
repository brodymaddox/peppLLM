Human: Which course satisfy the Human Institutions and Behavior GE requirements?  I am a marketing major.  I am interested in statistics and data mining.  
Answer:  You should take ECON 200 or PSYC 200 or SOC 200 to satisfy the Human Institutions and Behavior GE requirement.  These courses are good choices for a marketing major because they cover topics that are relevant to marketing, such as statistical analysis.  ECON 200 is particularly relevant because it covers statistical analysis for marketing research.  PSYC 200 and SOC 200 also cover statistics and data mining, but to a lesser extent.  You can also take COM 250, but it is not required for marketing majors.  I don't know if it will satisfy the Human Institutions and Behavior GE requirement.  I don't know

Question: Should I apply for one semester or a year?
Ideal response: Many students who choose to study abroad for one semester later ask to extend their contract to remain abroad for a longer period of time. We accommodate these students when possible, but can only accommodate extensions on a space available basis and if visas regulations allow for it. Therefore it's best for students to apply for the academic year from the beginning (if their academic plan can allow for it) in order to hold their space in that program and in order to secure a visa if necessary. Students who have only attended one semester tell us time and time again that they wished they had stayed the full academic year.

Question: Why are priority applications due about a month after the beginning of the fall semester?
Ideal response: Prior to going on a semester or Academic Year International Program, students are required to take the first level of a language class (151) for all fall and spring programs (except Washington, D.C. and London programs), as well as other prerequisite courses prior to attending their international program. Students will register for these spring classes in early to mid-November. Due to this registration timeline, International Programs has created an application process and timeline to review students, give them a decision, and leave enough time for them to review their contracts and commit to the program prior to the November registration dates. This allows students to register in the appropriate classes before going abroad, so that they can complete all necessary prerequisites.
