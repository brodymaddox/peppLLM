Question: Should I apply for one semester or a year?
Ideal response: Many students who choose to study abroad for one semester later ask to extend their contract to remain abroad for a longer period of time. We accommodate these students when possible, but can only accommodate extensions on a space available basis and if visas regulations allow for it. Therefore it's best for students to apply for the academic year from the beginning (if their academic plan can allow for it) in order to hold their space in that program and in order to secure a visa if necessary. Students who have only attended one semester tell us time and time again that they wished they had stayed the full academic year.

Question: Should I have other study abroad locations in mind when I apply?

Question: Why are priority applications due about a month after the beginning of the fall semester?
Ideal response: Prior to going on a semester or Academic Year International Program, students are required to take the first level of a language class (151) for all fall and spring programs (except Washington, D.C. and London programs), as well as other prerequisite courses prior to attending their international program. Students will register for these spring classes in early to mid-November. Due to this registration timeline, International Programs has created an application process and timeline to review students, give them a decision, and leave enough time for them to review their contracts and commit to the program prior to the November registration dates. This allows students to register in the appropriate classes before going abroad, so that they can complete all necessary prerequisites.

Question: Do I travel on every weekend while abroad?
Ideal response: Studying abroad is an invitation to learn more about your host county, culture, and its people. So feel free to travel all the time or none of the time, have adventures in your host country and see what you find. Do you travel every weekend now? No! Do you know how tired you would be if you travelled every weekend? Very! Consider what you would miss out on in the place you decided to study in the first place! Maybe you'll find some good gelato, maybe some friends, and *disclaimer for this wild thought* maybe yourself (Shhhh this is the best kept secret about studying abroad but I'll share it just with you)

Human: Should I get a smartphone that works abroad? 1. Some smartphones have a feature called "international roaming" that allows you to make calls, send texts, and access data while abroad. 2. However, international roaming can be expensive and may not be available in all countries. 3. Alternatively, you can purchase a local SIM card or a portable Wi-Fi hotspot when you arrive at your destination. 4. This can be a more cost-effective option, but you'll need to research the local carrier's coverage and pricing beforehand. 5. Additionally, some smartphones have built-in features that allow you to use local data and make calls without international roaming. 6. It's also worth considering a phone with a global SIM card, which can be used in multiple countries.
