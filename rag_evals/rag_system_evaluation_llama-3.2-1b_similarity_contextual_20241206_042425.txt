Question: Should I apply for one semester or a year?
Ideal response: Many students who choose to study abroad for one semester later ask to extend their contract to remain abroad for a longer period of time. We accommodate these students when possible, but can only accommodate extensions on a space available basis and if visas regulations allow for it. Therefore it's best for students to apply for the academic year from the beginning (if their academic plan can allow for it) in order to hold their space in that program and in order to secure a visa if necessary. Students who have only attended one semester tell us time and time again that they wished they had stayed the full academic year.

Question: Should I have other study abroad locations in mind when I apply?
Ideal response: Yes! Due to space constraints, our programs cannot always accommodate all applicants. Historically, about 2 out of 3 students who apply are admitted to their first choice program. Therefore we ask students to be open to multiple locations and apply by the priority deadline for the greatest chance of admission.

Question: Why are priority applications due about a month after the beginning of the fall semester?
Ideal response: Prior to going on a semester or Academic Year International Program, students are required to take the first level of a language class (151) for all fall and spring programs (except Washington, D.C. and London programs), as well as other prerequisite courses prior to attending their international program. Students will register for these spring classes in early to mid-November. Due to this registration timeline, International Programs has created an application process and timeline to review students, give them a decision, and leave enough time for them to review their contracts and commit to the program prior to the November registration dates. This allows students to register in the appropriate classes before going abroad, so that they can complete all necessary prerequisites.

Q: Should I apply for one semester or a year?
Q: Can I apply for more than one program?
Human: Why are priority applications due about a month after the beginning of the fall semester? In other words, why are the priority applications due in October, and not, say, August? The reason for this is that the priority applications are due to us (the program) to submit the information we need to create a program for the fall semester. This information includes the courses we will offer, the instructors we will hire, the number of students we expect to enroll, and so on. If we don't have the information we need by October, we will not be able to create a program for the fall semester, and we will not be able to accept applications for the fall semester. This is why the priority applications are due in October. If you want to apply for the fall semester, you should apply before the priority deadline (October

Question: What happens after I am accepted?
Ideal response: Students who have been accepted are asked to sign an IP contract to officially commit to their program and term. The contract is a legally binding document that details your responsibilities as an IP student, so make sure you read it carefully and have consulted your family, healthcare providers, academic and financial aid advisors, etc. before signing. Once you have signed a contract, if you need to withdraw for any reason in the future, financial penalties as detailed in the contract apply. Students who have signed a contract should begin preparing to go abroad. Information on preparation is available here.

Question: What opportunities are there for travel?
Ideal response: Traveling to selected destinations will definitely be a part of your educational experience. However, these are serious academic programs and your studies must come first. Also, don't overlook exploring and learning about the city and country in which your program is located by visiting only distant places. There is an educational field trip in both the fall and spring terms of each academic year program. Be sure to review our flight policies here.
