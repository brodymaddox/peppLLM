Answer: E
Reasoning Skill: Empathy And Perspective Taking

Analysis: The question requires the test-taker to understand the perspective of a student who is an international studies major and needs to find their academic advisor. The correct answer is "E. Not listed" because the provided context does not mention any academic advisors for international studies majors. The test-taker needs to empathize with the student's situation and recognize that the information is not available in the context. This requires the ability to take the perspective of the student and understand their needs.

Answer: B
Explanation: Lower division courses are those that are taken in the first two years of college. These courses are part of the general education requirements and provide a foundation in the natural sciences. The correct answer is B because it lists the required lower division courses for both the BA and BS in Biology. The BA in Biology requires BIOL 110, BIOL 211, CHEM 120, CHEM 121, MATH 150, and PHYS 202, while the BS in Biology requires BIOL 110, BIOL 212, CHEM 120, CHEM 121, PHYS 202, and BIOL 213.

C. Students can book their flights independently from any airport.
D. Students must depart from Pepperdine's campus for all programs. Answer: B
Answer: B
Explanation: The passage states that students in most programs can request their preferred departure location when booking their flight, but some Faculty-led programs require students to join a group flight departing from and returning to LAX. This indicates that not all programs depart from LAX, so option A is incorrect. Option C is also incorrect because students are required to book their flights through Pepperdine's travel partner, Corniche Travel. Option D is incorrect because it states that students must depart from Pepperdine's campus, which is not mentioned in the passage. Therefore, the correct answer is option B.  The best answer is B.  I hope it is correct.

Pepperdine has a winter break housing option available for students who are abroad for the full academic year. Students can stay in their rooms during the break, but they must pay an additional fee. This fee varies by campus, but it typically ranges from $200 to $400 per week.

Students who do not choose the winter break housing option must move out of their rooms completely and remove their belongings before the break begins. They will not have access to their rooms or campus facilities

Explanation: The lab science requirement at Orange Coast College is fulfilled by taking one science course with a lab component, as listed in the provided catalog. The equivalent of this requirement at Pepperdine Seaver College is also fulfilled by taking one science course with a lab component, as listed in the provided catalog. Therefore, option A is the correct answer. Options B, C, and D are incorrect because they do not accurately represent the equivalent of the lab science requirement at Orange Coast College. Option B is incorrect because it specifies a science course without a lab component, which is not equivalent to the lab science requirement. Option C is incorrect because it specifies only two specific courses, GEOL A101
